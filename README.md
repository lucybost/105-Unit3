# 105-Unit3
This is a repsotitory containing instructional materials for Professor Gotzler's fall 2022 sections of ENGL-105 at the Univeristy of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

The repository contains 3 Python notebooks covering basic topics and coding with Python3 and beginner moduels on using the Pandas package for data analysis
These materials have been adapted from the lessons created by the staff at the Research Hub of [UNC's Davis Library](https://unc-libraries-data.github.io/Python/Setup.html) 

This data came from the World Health Organization and was provided by Professor Gotzler. The coding came from Jupyter Lab notebooks. 

This data and code are/is meant for individuals trying to study the impact of mental health on early death rates. This infomration could be studied in reagrds to suicide or overall deterring physical health caused by mental states. The code has narrowed this subject matter down to individuals only in the state of New York. 

This repository was created with the hopes further research could be done with the use of this data from such a large and populated state. This information may help medical professionals and researchers determine the correlation between bad mental health and ealry death rates that could be used for cures and the evolvement of therapy techniques,
