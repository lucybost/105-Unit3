#### This is a repsotitory containing data surrounding the correlation of poor mental health to early death. It was created for Professor Gotzler's fall 2022 sections of ENGL-105 at the Univeristy of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

The repository contains 3 Python notebooks covering basic instructions on how to narrow down our data set into only containing the information we want to durther study. 
These materials will cbe studied to develope a relationship between the two areas and determine ways in which to stop this correlation. 

This data came from the World Health Organization and was provided by Professor Gotzler. The coding came from Jupyter Lab notebooks. 

This data and code are meant for individuals trying to study the impact of mental health on early death rates. This infomration could be studied in reagrds to suicide or overall deterring physical health caused by mental states. 
- The code has narrowed this subject matter down to individuals only in the state of New York. 

This repository was created with the hopes further research could be done with the use of this data from such a large and populated state. This information may help medical professionals and researchers determine the correlation between bad mental health and ealry death rates that could be used for cures and the evolvement of therapy techniques.
